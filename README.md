Script Framework written in PHP

EZE-CORES separates web-applications into Layout content (html, xhtml, css, javascript), PHP scripting, and an “engine” file that embeds variables from scripting directly into the layout content as requested.

Easy to use PHP class (include & use) for generating web-modules for script output.
